    <p>
      Biryani is a mixed rice dish originating from South Asia. It is typically
      made with long-grain rice, such as basmati, and meat, such as chicken,
      lamb, or goat. The rice is cooked with a variety of spices, including
      saffron, turmeric, and cardamom, and the meat is marinated in a
      yogurt-based sauce. The dish is often layered with fried onions and nuts,
      and it is usually sealed and cooked over low heat to allow the flavors to
      meld.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Basmati rice</li>
      <li>Meat</li>
      <li>Yogurt</li>
      <li>Spices</li>
      <li>Ghee or oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Marinate the meat: Combine yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, spices, and
        lemon juice (optional) in a bowl. Add your chosen meat (chicken, lamb,
        goat, etc.) and coat it evenly in the marinade. Let it rest for at least
        30 minutes, or preferably overnight, for deeper flavors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the rice: Rinse and soak basmati rice in water for 30 minutes.
        Drain and cook the rice in boiling water with salt and a few whole
        spices like cardamom and cloves until it's about 80% cooked (al dente).
        Drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the aromatics: Heat ghee or oil in a pot or Dutch oven. Fry sliced
        onions until golden brown. Add ginger-garlic paste (if not already in
        the marinade) and cook until fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble the biryani: Layer the cooked rice, marinated meat (along with
        any marinade residue), and fried onions in the pot. You can add other
        ingredients like fried nuts, raisins, or chopped vegetables at this
        stage for additional flavor and texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Seal and cook: Pour in enough water or stock to just cover the rice.
        Seal the pot tightly with foil or a tight-fitting lid. Cook on low heat
        for about 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked and the meat
        is tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rest and serve: Once cooked, turn off the heat and let the biryani rest
        for another 10-15 minutes with the lid on, allowing the flavors to
        further develop. Fluff the rice gently with a fork before serving.
